## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test

After installing everything, test that it works:

```cmd
# Navigate to your ProofPix folder
cd C:\Users\imadn\Desktop\proofpix

# Test Go
go version

# Test Terraform
terraform version

# Test Google Cloud CLI
gcloud --version

# Build your Go app (this should work now!)
go build -o bin/api cmd/api/main.go

# Run your API
.\bin\api
```

If the API runs, you should see: `ProofPix API server starting on port 8080...`
Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see "Hello World from ProofPix API!"

## ðŸŒŸ Next Steps After Installation

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**:
   ```cmd
   # Create a new project (replace 'my-proofpix-project' with your desired name)
   gcloud projects create my-proofpix-project --name="ProofPix"
   
   # Set it as your active project
   gcloud config set project my-proofpix-project
   
   # Enable billing (you'll need to do this in the web console)
   ```

2. **Configure Terraform**:
   ```cmd
   # Copy the example configuration
   copy terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your project ID
   notepad terraform.tfvars
   ```

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```cmd
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
